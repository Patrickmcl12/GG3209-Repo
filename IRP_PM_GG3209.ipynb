    "\n",
    "In the modern day world we are witnessing urban change and land use changes within day to day lives. Land is frequently being altered in order to cater for different physical, social, and enviromental changes which in most cases can be beneficial but also detrimental at the same time. Within this research project i will source data from areas such as Open Street Maps and Satellite imagery to help gauge better visual perspectives of these changes. From there I will import this data into QGIS in order to allign certain maps/data together and to extract certain features which can help draw attention to more specific areas. I will also aim to use python against the data in order to help locate specific strings of information and categories more efficiently \n"
